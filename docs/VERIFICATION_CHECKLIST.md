# Homebridge Plugin Verification Checklist

This document tracks compliance with [Homebridge Verified Plugin Requirements](https://github.com/homebridge/verified/blob/latest/verified-plugins.md).

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-08
**Requirements Version:** 2024-11-02

---

## Status Overview

- ✅ = Compliant
- ⚠️ = Needs Action
- ❌ = Not Compliant

---

## GENERAL

### ✅ Dynamic Platform Type

**Requirement:** The plugin must be of type dynamic platform.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- `config.schema.json:3` - `"pluginType": "platform"`
- `src/platform.ts:23` - Implements `DynamicPlatformPlugin`
- Accessories are dynamically discovered and registered

---

### ✅ Unique Functionality

**Requirement:** The plugin must not offer the same nor less functionality than that of any existing verified plugin.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

**What Makes This Plugin Unique:**

This plugin serves a specific hardware combination **NOT supported by any other Homebridge plugin**:

- **Hardware:** Somfy RTS motors + Inteo/Neocontrol hub
- **API:** Neocontrol cloud API (`http://iOS.neocontrolglobal.com:9151`)
- **Control Method:** Scene-based control via Inteo app
- **Market:** Popular in Mexico and Latin America
- **Documentation:** README explicitly states this is NOT for TaHoma, Connexoon, myLink, or other Somfy systems

**Competing Plugins (Different Hardware):**

- `homebridge-tahoma` - For Somfy TaHoma hubs (different API)
- `homebridge-connexoon` - For Somfy Connexoon hubs (different API)
- `homebridge-mylink` - For Somfy myLink bridges (different API)

**Verification:**

- [x] Searched Homebridge Verified Plugins list - no Inteo/Neocontrol plugins exist
- [x] Documented unique value proposition in README
- [x] Clarified this is NOT a general Somfy plugin

---

## REPO

### ✅ NPM Publication & GitHub Repository

**Requirement:** The plugin must be published to NPM and the source code available on a GitHub repository, with issues enabled.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

- ✅ GitHub Issues are enabled
- ✅ Issues URL configured in package.json
- ✅ **Published to NPM** - Version 1.0.0 live on registry
- ✅ Package installable: `npm install homebridge-inteo-somfy-blinds`
